                        <h3>Specch_Emotion_Recognization Usnig Python <3</h3>
                        <p>       A AI ML BASED ,,
                            In this developing world of AI, we have a Speech Emotion Recognition system to support the daily task of a working professional. It comes with its own pros and cons which have been also discussed in this project. It is easy to develop yet very easy to use and will develop more in the coming times. It is one more step ahead in the field of technology to understand human emotion and its behaviors. Emotion-sensing technologies can help employees make better decisions, improve their focus and performance in the workplace, manage stress, and help them adopt healthier and more productive working styles. Emotion-sensing technology will also enable companies to establish deeper emotional connections with their consumers through virtual assistants. Data collected through such devices can help companies understand how internal and external environmental factors impact their employees. As a result, companies can redesign processes accordingly, to help keep their personnel better engaged and productive. 
                            Speech recognition relies upon “feature analysis,” which is “speaker independent”. This method processes voice input using phonetic unit recognition and finds similarities between expected inputs and the actual digitized voice input. Simply put, it matches a user’s speech to generic voice patterns. Highly accurate speaker-independent speech recognition is challenging to achieve as accents, inflections, and different languages thwart the process. An example of speech recognition technology in use is speech-to-text platforms such as Speech Matics or Google’s speech-to-text engine. In addition, many voice assistants offer speech-to-text translation.

                        <h3>Machine Learning Algorithm for Image and Text
                            Steganography Using DCT in Python <3</h3>
                        <p>Digital image steganography is the process of embedding information within a cover image in
                            a secure, imperceptible, and recoverable way. The three main methods of digital image
                            steganography are spatial, transform, and neural network methods. Spatial methods modify the
                            pixel values of an image to embed information, while transform methods embed hidden
                            information within the frequency of the image. Neural network-based methods use neural networks
                            to perform the hiding process, which is the focus of the proposed methodology.
                             This research explores the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in digital image
                            steganography. This work extends an existing implementation that used a two-dimensional CNN
                            to perform the preparation, hiding, and extraction phases of the steganography process. The
                            methodology proposed in this research, however, introduced changes into the structure of the CNN
                            and used a gain function based on several image similarity metrics to maximize the
                            imperceptibility between a cover and steganographic image.
                             The performance of the proposed method was measured using some frequently utilized
                            image metrics such as structured similarity index measurement (SSIM), mean square error (MSE),
                            and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). The results showed that the steganographic images
                            produced by the proposed methodology are imperceptible to the human eye, while still providing
                            good recoverability. Comparing the results of the proposed methodology to the results of the
                            original methodology revealed that our proposed network greatly improved over the base
                            methodology in terms of SSIM and compares well to existing steganography methods.</p>
